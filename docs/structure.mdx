description: Learn how next-forge apps and packages are structured.

- each package should be self-contained and not depend on other packages
- each app should be self-contained and not depend on other apps
- each package should export everything that is needed by the app e.g. middleware, hooks, components, etc.

- each package can export a `keys` file that contains the package's environment variables
- each app can export a `env` file that composes the environment variables from the packages it depends on
